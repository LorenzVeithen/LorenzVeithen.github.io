Master thesis on the use of solar sails for a space debris removal mission around Earth, part of the [SWEEP](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ae/sweep) project. My work aims to determine if a tumbling sailcraft can retrieve attitude and orbital control using common propellantless attitude control systems currently envisioned for photonic propulsion missions.

The thesis can be viewed on the [TU Delft repository](https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:7733489c-334f-4bca-8f5c-8c8841849be4).
