Master thesis on the use of solar sails for a space debris removal mission around Earth, part of the [SWEEP](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ae/sweep) project. My work aims to determine if a tumbling sailcraft can retrieve attitude and orbital control using common propellantless attitude control systems currently envisioned for photonic propulsion missions.

The thesis will be published in August 2024.
