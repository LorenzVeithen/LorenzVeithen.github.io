The Supersonic Heatshield Experiment Aboard REXUS (SHEAR) is a project created by the Parachute Research Group (PRG) of Delft Aerospace Rocket Engineering (DARE). It is meant to follow up on a research project conducted earlier by PRG members Anand Raja and Esmée Menting, aimed at developing a more efficient heat shield material than cork, the material currently used in DARE missions. This project resulted in the development of sodium alginate and montmorillonite nanoclay composite foam, hereafter referred to as Alg-MMT nanocomposite foam. This material appears to have promising thermal as well as mechanical properties, however, it is yet to be proven in sounding rocket flight conditions.





The development of such a material was deemed necessary as DARE missions are aiming to reach increasingly high altitudes. Stratos III, a DARE flagship rocket launched in 2018, was designed to break the European student altitude record for sounding rockets, set at 32.2 km. Its successor, Stratos IV, was designed to be capable of reaching an altitude of 100 km. The latter uses a heat shield made of cork and carbon fibre to protect the parachutes inside the recovery bay during re-entry. A potential future mission aiming to reach even higher altitudes will also require a more durable heat shield: either a thicker layer of cork, or a different material.




It is known from previous experiments that Alg-MMT nanocomposite foam has a maximum practical use temperature of 1450°C. This is a significantly higher temperature than a Stratos IV-like sounding rocket would experience during re-entry, meaning that theoretically, the material should be suitable for use as a heat shield. However, more aspects of the material should be tested to confirm this, such as its integration with a vehicle, and its performance under high dynamic pressures.




In order to flight-prove Alg-MMT nanocomposite foam, PRG required a reliable sounding rocket capable of reaching high altitudes, in the same range as Stratos IV. As no such rocket was available within DARE in the near future, other options needed to be considered. As PRG had previous experience participating in the REXUS/BEXUS programme with the SPEAR mission, the decision was made to propose an experiment to be flown on a REXUS rocket. This experiment, named SHEAR as a nod to the earlier SPEAR mission, was accepted to fly in December 2021, and will allow the team to flight-prove the heat shield material at supersonic velocities.
