Regmaglypts are shallow depressions on meteorite surfaces formed by the ablation processes during atmospheric entry. These features can potentially offer insights in break-up events. However, quantitative methods to analyse regmaglypts have not yet been proposed, so far. In this project, we investigated the use of regmaglypt morphometrics to evaluate break-up processes during the luminous flight of meteorites. We developed a novel approach based on a 3-D shape model of the Broek in Waterland meteorite that was generated using photogrammetry, and analyses of the surface.
