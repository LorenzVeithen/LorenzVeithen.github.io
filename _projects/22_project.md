Climate change is the greatest crisis that mankind has ever been in as its effects will be unprecedented and might result in apocalyptic scenarios. Geoengineering can be used to save time to switch to green energy and to offset the effects of climate change in general. The aim of this report is to locate the use of space mirrors in the climate change crisis. Space Mirrors is a geoengineering technique, that relies on the fact that deflecting about 1.8\% of the total incoming sunlight on Earth could offset a 2 $\degree$C temperature increase. Two promising concepts were selected to investigate in this report with the aim to locate the role of the technique of space mirrors in the field of geoengineering: the cloud and the ring concepts. The cloud idea consists of putting small flyers at the Lagrange point L1 to deflect the incoming sunlight, while the ring concept consists of forming rings, as the ones of Saturn, from captured asteroid particles in the same goal. Both techniques are analysed as a way to delay climate change. The role of space mirrors was found to be a last resort technology. It is one of the most expensive options but is guaranteed to work if implemented correctly, therefore, it should be implemented if it is known that the tipping point of Earth's climate is about to be reached. The cloud concept shall be selected if space mirrors are to be used as it relies less on far stretched technologies and is less expensive. The technique also needs to be used along other methods such as carbon capture and the transition to green energy. Further research in the technique on space mirrors should focus on it's local effects and cost-reduction methods.
