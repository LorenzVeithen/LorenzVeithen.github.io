  title={Predictor-Controller Approach for Q-Law 6th Element Targeting in Low-Thrust Trajectory Design},
  author={Veithen, Lorenz and Keller, Maximilian},
  abstract={Electric propulsion enables ambitious and affordable space missions by substantially reducing the fuel mass in comparison to lower specific impulse propulsion. However, the optimisation of the according transfer trajectories is particularly challenging due to their typically low thrust characteristics, resulting in many-revolution transfers with many local minima and highly non- linear dynamics. The Q-Law guidance algorithm can provide near-optimal low-thrust trajectories with minimal computational effort, which can be used either as an initial guess for the optimisation to ensure a faster convergence or directly for mission analysis. In the classical formulation presented by [1] the Q-law does not allow to target a specific position in the final orbit, rendering a poor initial guess in cases where it is a constraint. Such a constraint could be the geographical longitude when acquiring a geostationary orbit, but also the position within a constellation of Low Earth Orbit and Medium Earth Orbit satellites, or within a rendezvous scenario. This study proposes a predictor-controller approach to enable Q-Law targeting capabilities for this fast- moving orbital element in the final orbit, as a generalisation to a method proposed by [2] to target a geographical longitude in geostationary orbit. This work uses the semi-major axis augmented Modified Equinoctial Elements formulation of the Q-law and has been tested for a range of orbital transfers with varying inclinations and eccentricities. A sensitivity analysis on the key parameters of the algorithm, with respect to its convergence, is presented. This approach permits to quickly compute near-optimal transfers to a specified slot in the final orbit.},

  title        = {{Feasibility Analysis of Small-Size Space Debris Removal in Low-Earth Orbit by Space-Based Laser Ablation}},
  abstract     = {As artificial objects in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) become more numerous, the risk for breakup events threatening space-based services increases rapidly. Laser ablation methods have previously been proposed for the removal of small-size (1 - 10 cm) debris fragments, but a mission-level feasibility study is yet to be performed. This work investigates the mission concept and spacecraft design feasibility of a space-based laser aiming to de-orbit 50% of the debris generated by an on-orbit catastrophic event, using an agent-based modelling approach applied to the 2009 Cosmos-Iridium collision example. Several parameters were varied to generate a feasibility envelope on the payload performance, showing that the necessary capabilities for mission feasibility are within ranges achievable with current or near-term technology. A cost estimate for a single-flight mission of 550 M€ was generated based on the conceptual design developed for this study and is in agreement with previous research. This work shows that a laser ablation concept for the removal of small-size debris in LEO is feasible both technically and financially. It further provides a modelling base for future research on similar concepts for different mission scenarios.},

  title={Morphometrics of regmaglypts based on a 3D Model of the fusion-crusted ordinary chondrite Broek in Waterland (L6)},
  author={Veithen, Lorenz and {de Vet}, Sebastiaan J.},
  abstract={Regmaglypts are shallow depressions on meteorite surfaces formed by ablation processes during atmospheric entry. These features can potentially offer insights in breakup events. However, quantitative methods to analyse regmaglypts have not yet been proposed to date. Here we present the results of a study to evaluate breakup processes during the luminous flight by analysing regmaglypt morphometrics. We developed a novel approach based on a 3D shape model of the Broek in Waterland meteorite that was generated using photogrammetry. We converted sections of the 3D model into a smoothed Digital Elevation Model (DEM) that contained the fracture surfaces adorned with regmaglypts. Lending techniques from terrain analyses, we extracted Land Surface Parameters (LSP) and delineated regmaglypts based on the mean curvature inflection point. The outliers of the regmaglypt population were discarded based on mean and total curvature scatter plots. The mean, profile, tangential, total and gaussian curvatures were found to be most descriptive of regmaglypt morphologies. Various other curvature types were tested and found to be consistent across the studied regmaglypt population. Using this initial framework, we found that the two regmaglypted surfaces of the Broek in Waterland meteorite appear to be similar. This would reflect similar formative conditions, which we interpret to be most consistent with formation from the same breakup event. Future studies will aim to expand the presented method to regmaglypt populations of other L6 meteorites to understand how surface characteristics can inform us on ablation and breakup processes.},
