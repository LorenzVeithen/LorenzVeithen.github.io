Attended and presented two papers at the 29th International Symposium on Space Flight Dynamics organised by the European Space Agency and EUMETSAT. One publication presents the work I performed during my internship at DLR, the other presents the work performed by my bachelor thesis team on small space debris removal. Details of these papers can be found in my [publications page](./publications/).
