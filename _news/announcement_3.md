Selected as one of the 20 best students of the TU Delft Aerospace Engineering first year cohort (450) to participate in the [bachelor honours programme](https://www.tudelft.nl/studenten/faculteiten/lr-studentenportal/onderwijs/bachelor/honours-programme). Within this programme, I will work as an undergraduate researcher at the [TU Delft Planetary Exploration group](https://www.delftplanetary.nl).
