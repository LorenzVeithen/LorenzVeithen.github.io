I previously obtained an MSc in Aerospace Engineering at the TU Delft specialising in spaceflight dynamics and engineering. I am passionate about bridging the gap between cutting-edge technologies and societal challenges, through both scientific research and entrepreneurship. My ambition is to contribute to the Research and Development of advanced concepts and technologies as a research engineer in, and founder of, early-stage startups. On the short-term, I wish to pursue a PhD in the field of numerical simulations used to develop disruptive technologies in fields lying at the heart of current challenges.</p> <p>You can find a short selection of my work performed through my studies and extracurricular projects in <a href="./projects">projects</a>, as well as an overview of my scientific contributions in <a href="./publications">publications</a>. Feel free to also check my <a href="./cv">CV</a> for a more global view of my past experiences.</p> <p>In my free time, I like to challenge myself physically. At the moment, I am particularly into running and training for my first marathon, don’t hesitate to join me on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/90448406" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Strava</a>!</p> </body></html>
