Hi, happy to see you here !





 I am an MPhil student in Scientific Computing at the University of Cambridge specialising in the modelling of continuum mechanics. Previously, I obtained an MSc in Aerospace Engineering at the TU Delft specialising in spaceflight dynamics and engineering. I am passionate about bridging the gap between cutting-edge technologies and societal challenges, through both scientific research and entrepreneurship. My ambition is to contribute to the Research and Development of advanced concepts and technologies as a research engineer in, and founder of, early-stage startups. On the short-term, I wish to pursue a PhD in the field of numerical simulations used to develop disruptive technologies in fields lying at the heart of current challenges.


You can find a short selection of my work performed through my studies and extracurricular projects in [projects](./projects), as well as an overview of my scientific contributions in [publications](./publications). Feel free to also check my [CV](./cv) for a more global view of my past experiences.


<!-- Aside from my studies at the [Faculty of Aerospace Engineering of the TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ae), I have gained a wide experience in the design and analysis of aerospace systems through my past involvement at [Team Tumbleweed](https://www.teamtumbleweed.eu/our-vision/) and the [Delft Aerospace Rocketry Engineering (DARE)](https://dare.tudelft.nl) society, and in scientific research through my work at the [TU Delft Planetary Exploration group](https://www.delftplanetary.nl), the [Astrodynamics and Space Missions group](https://www.tudelft.nl/lr/organisatie/afdelingen/space-engineering/astrodynamics-and-space-missions), and [DLR-GSOC](https://www.dlr.de/en/research-and-transfer/projects-and-missions/iss/the-german-space-operations-center). During the 2023-2024 academic year, I have been selected as one of the 40 highest achieving students from the five leading engineering universities in Europe to take part in the [IDEA League Challenge Programme](https://idealeague.org/students/challengeprogramme/). Through these opportunities, I have become especially interested in the development of disruptive technologies lying at the heart of solutions of global challenges ranging from climate change and the space debris crisis to efficient ways to explore our solar system. -->





In my free time, I like to challenge myself physically. At the moment, I am particularly into running and training for my first marathon, don't hesitate to join me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/90448406)!
