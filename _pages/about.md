Hi, happy to see you here ! My name is Lorenz Veithen, I am currently an MSc student in Aerospace Engineering at the TU Delft specialising in spaceflight. I wish to dedicate my career to bridging the gap between societal challenges and cutting-edge technologies.
My interests range from numerical simulations, astrodynamics and space mission design to entrepreneurship.


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](_pages/publications) automatically.




In my free time, I like to challenge myself physically. At the moment, I am particularly into running and training for my first marathon, don't hesitate to join me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/90448406)!
