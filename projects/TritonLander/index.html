The Voyager 2 probe visited the Neptune System for the first time in 1989; since then, no other mission has investigated the planet at the farthest reaches of the Solar System and its singular moon. As a consequence, little is known about this intriguing destination. As a moon, Triton stands out for its uniqueness in the orbit of Neptune, making up 96% of the orbiting mass around the body. It is also unique compared to other moons in the Solar System due to its curious retrograde orbit, the nature and origins of which have not yet been fully discerned. Triton also belongs to the category of icy moons, which have sparked debates about the potential presence of organic molecules within their icy shells. All of these factors make Triton one of the most attractive scientific objectives in the Solar System. %A bit rough, but this is the general idea (perhaps add a bit about plumes)</p> <p>The POSEIDON mission will be the first mission to land on Triton and send back scientific data. It will characterise its surface composition, revealing details about the moon’s cryovolcanic activity and geological past; it will yield additional clues on its internal structure, settling the debate on the presence of an internal ocean and the mechanisms that create it. It will also study Triton’s plumes in detail, searching for potential biomarkers that could give an indication about the presence of life elsewhere in the Solar System.</p> <p>The mission aims to answer two fundamental scientific questions: what the origin of Triton is, and whether or not it can support life. The former question can be explored by different means. POSEIDON aims to combine a comparative planetology approach with a deep analysis of Triton’s features in an attempt to answer the questions. A close inspection of the planet’s surface may yield indications of it being a Kuiper Belt Object, captured at some point in the near or distant past. A clearer understanding of Triton’s interior structure — including the likely presence of a subsurface ocean — might yield insights into the nature of this potential capture event, and reveal the mechanism behind the plumes that litter the surface of the body. The latter question of whether Triton can support life is investigated through the analysis of organic molecules that may be ejected from Triton’s plumes. If found, these might yield clues as to what kind of molecules and compounds can be found deep within the moon’s icy shell, where minerals are thought to flow freely and abundantly within the subsurface ocean, which itself is kept liquid and warm by the heat of the moon’s core — both of these being essential ingredients for life as we know it.</p> <p>Triton’s interior holds a number of mysteries, from the origin of the plumes found on the surface to the likely presence of a subsurface ocean. Determining the interior structure of the moon will shed light into the possibility of the moon containing substantial amounts of liquid water — a primary ingredient for any body to harbour life — and present a clearer picture of Triton’s recent past, through means of measuring the thickness of its icy shell. The determination of the interior structure is done through the use of novel techniques employing seismometers.</p> <p>Triton’s plumes are particularly fascinating as they serve as a window into the moon’s subsurface. Through in-situ measurements of the plumes’ composition as well as some measurements of their seismic activity, further insight can be gained into the presence of a subsurface ocean, and the possibility of life. Gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and flow cytometry measurements will all be performed on samples taken directly from the plumes below Triton’s surface to give POSEIDON the best opportunity to detect potential biomarkers. These biomarkers include methane produced from biogenic processes, polynucleotides, and lipids. POSEIDON’s rocket-operated plume experiment will navigate into the plumes and collect samples, keeping them in their ambient conditions until analysis on the lander can be performed.</p> <p>Inspection of Triton’s surface can give new insights into its origin, the presence of life, its current geological activity, and the driving force behind resurfacing events. %Bodies origin part should be put here with payloads. %Support of life with subsurface oceans and payloads should be put here Investigating geological features, such as the undulating high plains, walled and terraced plains, zoned maculae, and cantaloupe terrain by means of high resolution imaging can help to characterize the surface processes that are ongoing on the body, and what internal processes are driving these. POSEIDON will analyse the icy surface for biomarkers, hoping to find similar types as those found on other Kuiper Belt Objects, as this could provide an answer to the origin of Triton. Furthermore, finding these potential biomarkers in the surface ice could help in determining whether life on Triton is possible, as biomarkers could travel through plumes and deposit on the ice over time.</p> <p>Although a secondary science objective, the atmosphere of Triton is very unique among solar system bodies due to its very low, but highly varying density and pressure, as well as its tenuous weather system. In order to gain a more thorough understanding of this atmosphere and how it might relate to similar bodies, a number of sensors will be used to measure pressure, temperature, wind, and acceleration, thereby characterising key atmospheric properties during the initial descent of the lander. This will provide crucial height-varying information not possible to be gathered from other means. Once the lander has touched down, these sensors will operate intermittently to gather data on the short term transient properties of the local atmospheric environment.</p> <p>The payload used to perform the measurements mentioned above will be hosted on a single stationary lander platform — as is customary for missions to mostly unknown planetary bodies — thereby improving its reliability compared to a rover. The mission will be launched towards the end of December 2039 and will reach Neptune in April 2056, before approaching Triton through a series of manoeuvres and flybys around the different bodies in the Neptunian system. An optimal landing site will be selected following a period of global mapping of the moon’s surface from orbit: this ideal position would be in the neighbourhood of an active plume, keeping an approximate distance of 1 [km] while being as close as possible to any relevant geological sites in the vicinity. This step will be followed by the Entry, Descent and Landing procedure, which will employ a powered gravity turn manoeuvre, and during which the lander will take measurements of the moon’s tenuous atmosphere. The gravity turn manoeuvre will be controlled by a Guidance, Navigation and Control unit (GNC), and a hazard avoidance system, ensuring that a safe final landing site is reached based on the information gathered by the on-board Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), radar altimeter and camera. Once the lander is resting safely on the surface of the target body the Early Operational Phase (EOP) is initiated, and all systems of the lander and its experiments are initialised and calibrated. The communication link to the orbiter — which will act as relay during the entire mission — is established, permitting to transmit health and descent data to the ground support team on Earth. At the end of the EOP, the 6 months —with a possible extension of 1.5 years — long operational phase is kicked off with the activation of the planned experiments. The Rocket-Operated Plume Experiment (ROPE) will be deployed as soon as the closest plume location relative to the lander has been established with the necessary degree of certainty. ROPE will then fly towards the plume and perform the aforementioned measurements, then return to the lander, whereafter the data gathered will be sent back to Earth. In order to sustain these operations, the POSEIDON lander will utilise an MMRTG provided by NASA as its main power source. In addition to this, a secondary Lithium-Ion rechargeable battery pack will be onboard to provide the necessary power during periods in which the MMRTG’s power supply is insufficient. The ROPE craft will be powered by a system separate from the lander, and will rely entirely on Lithium-Ion batteries to meet its power needs during operation. Once the mission is deemed complete — whether this be after six months or two years — the lander will begin its own decommissioning by physically disconnecting the MMRTG from the bus, in order to prevent any possible battery explosions or interference with future missions to Neptune or Triton.</p> <p>The lander bus design is shown in the figure below, and was used as a reference for the overall system mass and power budgets. Along with the main scientific instruments, the lander contains a robotic manipulator arm to aid in instrument deployment and the operation of the spectrometer. The lander has overall dimensions of 2.75 x 2.75 x 1.4 [m] [LxWxH], and a mass of 466[kg]. The average power draw of the lander is under the 110[W] output of the MMRTG, except during initial descent, during which supplemental power is supplied by a secondary battery source.</p> <object data="https://LorenzVeithen.github.io/assets/pdf/TritonLander-PSII.pdf" width="1000" height="1000" type="application/pdf"></object> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Lorenz A.V.
