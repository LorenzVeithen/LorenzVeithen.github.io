Lighting of highways plays a pivotal role in ensuring the safety of its drivers during night hours. These infrastructures enable drivers to see potential hazards beyond the reach of their car lights, permit them to see each other, and help them to navigate on the road safely. With more than 2600 km of highways to illuminate in The Netherlands, it is of the uttermost importance to reach an optimised structural and light spreading design to ensure a cost-effective implementation. This report aims to provide an overview of the optimisation process of the typical street light structural design to minimise costs, while maximising the illuminated area. To account for the former, the mass of the structure will be minimised.
